# Active Directory Administration and IT Service Operations Simulation

This project shows my practical experience working with **Active Directory**, including creating and managing user accounts, groups, and security policies. It reflects real Help Desk responsibilities such as account provisioning, permission management, and configuring Group Policy in an enterprise IT environment.

## Environments and Technologies Used

- **Windows Server 2022**
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**
- **Event Viewer**
- **Oracle VirtualBox**


## Skills Demonstrated

- User account lifecycle management (creation, modification, and removal)
- Organizational Unit (OU) structuring
- Group and permission administration
- Enforcing security and password policies
- Auditing and troubleshooting with Event Viewer
- Creating and configuring Group Policy Objects (GPOs)


## Tasks for this project

### 1. New User Provisioning in Active Directory
Created and configured a new user account in **Active Directory**, assigning it to the appropriate **Organizational Unit (OU)** to ensure proper directory structure and policy alignment.
